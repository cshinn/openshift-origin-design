# Catalog

- The Catalog section is found at the bottom of the web console homepage.
- The Catalog contains catalog items and provides the means to browse, sort, and filter them.


## Browse Catalog

![catalog](https://redhat.invisionapp.com/static-signed/live-embed/14678702/277164988/4/latest/XKvjlEI0WsUmJk02uljzy2MvmlA5HaCXJlEXjGzBaawXV8zU6b2bXA0ZR2iCFRnO4QmvSRXclEvpAZrWeiMTLOFJglE/membership-1-2x.png)
- Initially, upon arriving on the page, the `All` section is highlighted, underlined and expanded, with the catalog items sorted alphabetically by name.
- Deploy Image and Import YAML/JSON links are available on the right side of the catalog primary categories bar.
- Clicking either link will trigger the relevant [overlay panel actions](http://openshift.github.io/openshift-origin-design/web-console/4-patterns/overlay-panel).

- Any tabs that have subcategories of catalog items will have those subcategories displayed as tiles.
- These tabs should also contain an a `All` tile for catalog items from all subcategories.

### Hover States
![hover](img/OpenShift-Next-Homepage-HoverItem-ProjectList.png)
- Primary categories are highlighted in a lighter blue on hover.
- Deploy Image and Import YAML are highlighted in a lighter blue on hover.
- Hovering over a catalog item will highlighted the item in a circle and change the item name to blue.

### Implementation Details
- Administrators should have the ability to determine which catalog items are available to users.      
- Disabled catalog items should not appear.    
- The `All` category should be the first primary category and it should always be displayed.
- For remaining primary category tabs, if no catalog items exist, the tab should be hidden.
- Initially, category tabs will be limited to the defined list shown, with the addition of an `Other` category for customers to place resources that donâ€™t fit in an existing category.
	- **Note:** Eventually, customers will have the capability to add their own custom category tabs.
- Some primary categories will have a secondary level of categorization available.
- For secondary levels of categorization, there should again be an `Other` category if there are items to display (not shown in mockup).
- Clicking on a subcategory will open a scrollable panel that contains the catalog items.

### Responsive State
![mobile-1](img/OpenShift-Next-Mobile-V2-scrolledup.png)

- On mobile, the catalog tabs should stack with arrows to the right.
- Deploy Image and Import YAML should be displayed below all primary categories and should have a different visual treatment from the tabs.

![mobile-2](img/OpenShift-Next-Mobile-subcategories.png)

- If subcategories exist, selecting the primary category will bring users to another screen to view subcategories as tiles.
- Clicking back will bring users back to the home page with all primary tabs listed.

![mobile-3](img/OpenShift-Next-Mobile-subcategoryselected-V2.png)

- Selecting a subcategory tile will bring users to another screen to view catalog items by scrolling.

![mobile-4](img/OpenShift-Next-Mobile-subcategorydropdown.png)
- The category title will be listed with a dropdown option to switch to another subcategory without navigating back to tiles.
- The current selection will be highlighted with the icon in full color. All other images are muted.
- Clicking "back" from this screen will navigate back to the initial Home Page (skipping the subcategory tile view).
- **Note:** When subcategories do not exist for a tab, selecting a primary category will bring the user directly to a screen like this (without a dropdown option at the top).

# Future Use Cases

## Filter Catalog Items

![catalog](img/catalog-04.png)
- Opening the filter dropdown enables the user to select a number of filters to apply to the current set of catalog items

#### Implementation Details
- Filters between categories are combined with an AND relationship
- Selecting a second filter within a category will replace the previous value for that category.
	- Filter values within each filter category should be selected with radio buttons
- The available filters may be different for each tab

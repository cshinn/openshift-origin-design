### Secondary Masthead

- The "crawl" phase will introduce a secondary masthead underneath the main masthead for project-related items.
- The top [masthead](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-origin-design/blob/master/web-console/4-patterns/masthead.md) will be consistent between the landing page and project details page.


#### Implementation Details
- The secondary masthead includes the project selection dropdown and the add to project dropdown.

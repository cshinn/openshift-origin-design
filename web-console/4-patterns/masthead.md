# Masthead

![Masthead](img/OS-masthead-02.png)  

The PatternFly [Masthead](http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/application-framework/masthead/#/design) design should be followed for the and in this case the masthead should include the following from left to right:
1. **Name and Branding** Red Hat OpenShift or OpenShift Online
1. **Launcher:** Follow the PF [Launcher](http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/application-framework/launcher/#/design) pattern, allowing users to switch to another application.
1. **Help:** This menu should include documentation, about, and command line tools, and guided tours.
1. **User:** The username should be listed to the right of the icon. The "Log Out" option should be available in this dropdown menu, as well as any other user settings available (depending on the version) such as "My Account".

**Note:** For full screen widths, the masthead does not include the hamburger menu on the landing page. Once the user navigates to a specific project inside the console, vertical navigation appears and the hamburger menu will show up in the top left corner of the masthead. See [Navigation](http://openshift.github.io/openshift-origin-design/web-console/4-patterns/navigation) design details for more information.

## Implementation Details

### Help
- The guided tour and the resources should always  be accessible under the help menu in the masthead.

- The menu item will be called "Guided Tour" and should come after "documentation" in the dropdown.
- Resources should be below the guided tour in the list and a flyout menu should appear with the 6 links available.
- **Note:** If customers have hidden the resource links from the homepage, they should not be displayed in the masthead either.

### Regions
- Users will have the ability to view and change their cluster region.
- For MVP, the cluster region will be listed as a fly-out option under the user menu in the masthead.  
- The current region will be displayed in the dropdown.

### System Alerts
- If system alerts exist, a warning icon will appear in the masthead as the left-most icon in the group (OpenShift Online ONLY)

- System alerts pertain to the infrastructure on which OpenShift is running. They are used to communicate system status to online users. (https://status.openshift.com/)
- System alerts are implemented via a javascript config extension point, so users are able to customize their OpenShift instance to override the warning icon and use the space as desired.

### Notification Drawer

- **NOTE:** The PatternFly [Notification Drawer](http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/communication/notification-drawer/#/design) is not yet implemented for MVP, but once it is implemented, a bell icon should be added to the masthead, directly to the left of the Launcher.
- When system alerts exist, they may still show up in the masthead, to the left of the notification drawer.

## Responsive Designs
- For the MVP, the responsive design will not change. On smaller viewports, all masthead actions/options will drop into the hamburger menu.
